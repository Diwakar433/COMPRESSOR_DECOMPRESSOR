# COMPRESSOR_DECOMPRESSOR

# Introduction

Introduction to new minor project on compressor and decompressor using Java language.
Objective of the project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique.
The project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression.
Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs.
Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing.
In the project, we will ensure that our compressed files can be restored to their original form.

# Technology

Two technologies used in the project: Java and Java Swing.
Java IO package is used to handle input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other sources.
Input file is compressed and output file is generated using the Java IO package.
like buttons, labels, and texts.
JFrame represents the main window when executing the project.
The project includes a button that, when clicked, pops up a window to select a file to be compressed or decompressed.

# Building Basic UI and logic explanation

There is building the basic layout and UI for a compressor/decompressor project.
It uses input and output streams to compress and decompress files.
They use Netbeans to create a Java application with Maven and name the project "Compressor Decompressor."
They create a GUI package and a new class "App Frame" to start building the basic layout.
We extends the JFrame class and implements ActionListener.
They create two buttons, the Compress button, and Decompress button, and use an ActionListener to detect which button was pressed.
They set the default close operation.

# After Run this code
Choose a any file from compressor button and save it. Then create a compressed file, it shows on your file location.
Similarly, for decompressor, Do same.
